## 1. Schedule

 <!-- * What is your team's weekly schedule of meetings outside of regular class times?  -->
 Our group has typically met ~4 times a week. We have averaged 2 weekly scrum meetings, one on Wednesday from 5-5:15, and the other during a flexible time, like during the weekend. Our scrum meetings have a speculative duration of 15 minutes, but discussion can occasionally last longer time permitting. Besides our scrum meetings, we run work meetings in which project work is done collaboratively. These meetings occur 2 or more times a week and in these, we work on items ranging from writing documents to assigning tasks to programming. Work meetings have no designated week day or time, but are decided at the beginning of each week based on the team's availability.
